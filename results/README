## Real data
For running tests on real telescope data, the test programs will automatically save reconstruction results in the following directory structure:

results
results/allvisibs
results/averaging
results/rgrid
results/rsing

## Simulations
Maintain all simulation results as MAT files here in per-image subdirectories.
"discarding" is a subdirectory to store reconstruction results from further
reduced data by discarding singular values etc.

Example:

results
results/m31
results/m31/discarding
